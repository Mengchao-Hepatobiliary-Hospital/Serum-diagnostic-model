# Serum-diagnostic-model

## Code of LVQ model for feature selection
- The corresponding file: DAPdata.Rdata
- The data in file "DAPdata" is DIA-MS quantitative profiles of 34 HCC-related differentially abundant proteins after pre-processing and median normalization.


## Code of P4-model for HCC diagnosis
- The corresponding file: PRMdata.Rdata
- The quantitative profiles in file "PRMdata" is exactly the same as that in file "Table S6. Targeted proteomic abundance profiles of 325 samples.csv".
- You can run the code using "RPMdata" directly or after tidying and simplifying "Table S6"
